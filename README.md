To do app project
I used several different youtube tutorials, Linkedin course, google and course lectures to finish this project.
Everything else works perfectly, exept local storage. I managed to save, delete and load saved content, but i didnt manage to save right content, it always saves "object object" for some reason. I tried several different tutorials and didnt get it to work properly. This project took a lot of time to finish, but i learned a lot.
