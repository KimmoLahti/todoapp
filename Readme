I used several different youtube tutorials, Linkedin course, google and course lectures to finish this project.
Everything else works perfectly, except local storage. 
I managed to save, delete and load saved content, but i didn't manage to save right content, it always saves "object object" for some reason.
I tried several different tutorials and didn't get local storage to work properly.
This project took a lot of time to finish, but i learned a lot.

App has form, add button, native javascript, published in netlify, pushed to github, readmefile, DOM scripting, separet files for css, html and javascript,
items on a list, input field checked for blank or content long enough, incorrect content in the input field triggers erroe message and red borders in input field,
can mark tasks as done and remove tasks, information is stored to local storage, but not working as intendet.
I think my project deserves 20 points.
